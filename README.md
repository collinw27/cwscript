# CWScript
A scripting language designed to be easy to understand, use, and implement without sacrificing any major features

### Specification
Language specification can be viewed in `spec.pdf`. It contains information about how the program is implemented, documentation for how to use the language, and the reasoning behind the language's design.

### Running files
Files can be passed as arguments to `main.py`:
```
python3 main.py sample_programs/basics.cw
```
Check for `sample_programs/` folder for examples on how to format code. More examples are currently being worked on!

### Syntax highlighting

If you use **Sublime Text 3** as your text editor, I have created two files to make working with `.cw` files easier to manage. Check the `sublime_files/` folder and follow the appropriate installation (see [Sublime Syntax Definitions](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/syntax.html)).
